1. The bug was that the calculateSum function is adding the two numbers in string type. This means that the result will be the literally string added together. In the test that I did, I put in '1' and '2'. The result that was returned was '12'. 
2. I fixed the issue by turning the string type to an integer type using the parseInt() in javascript.
